    1. Shuffle Play - This shuffles the order of the slides and starts the presentation
    2. Loop Play    - This shuffles the order of the slides and starts the presentation while also looping the slide show
    3. Reset Order  - This resets the shuffled order back to the previous state
    
Install Instructions:

    1. Download the zip file below and run the "setup.exe" inside
