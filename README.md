This PowerPoint add-in allows you too randomize the order of your slides before running the presentation.

There are three buttons added to the "Slide Show" ribbon:
  1. **Shuffle Play** - This shuffles the order of the slides and starts the presentation
  2. **Loop Play**    - This shuffles the order of the slides and starts the presentation while also looping the slide show
  3. **Reset Order**  - This resets the shuffled order back to the previous state

To install, simply download the zip file below and run the "setup.exe" inside.

Then, if your PowerPoint is currently running, restart the application.

To uninstall this add-in:
    1. Go to "Add or Remove Programs" on your computer
    2. Search for the name "RandomSlideOrder"
    3. Choose uninstall on options (Three dots on the right).
